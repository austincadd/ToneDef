# ðŸ”— Sections Connected - Grey Space Removed

## âœ… **Successfully Fixed!**

The grey space between the "Trusted by Top Artists" and "Let's build something together" sections has been removed.

### ðŸŽ¨ **Changes Made:**

**1. Updated Trusted Artists Section Background:**
- Changed from: `linear-gradient(135deg, #0a0a0a 0%, #1a1a1a 100%)`
- Changed to: `linear-gradient(135deg, var(--tonedef-dark) 0%, var(--tonedef-forest) 100%)`
- Updated padding: `5rem 0 2rem 0` (added small bottom spacing)

**2. Updated Footer Contact Section:**
- Added `margin-top: -1px` to pull up and connect with trusted artists section
