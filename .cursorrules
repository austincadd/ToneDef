## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### File Structure:
- **Sections**: All page sections are in `/sections/` directory
- **Styles**: Main CSS in `/assets/single-page-basic.css`, section-specific CSS in `/assets/section-*.css`
- **Layout**: Main theme layout in `/layout/theme.liquid`
- **Templates**: Page templates in `/templates/` directory

### Common Modifications:
1. **Button Styling**: Look for `.btn`, `.button`, or CTA classes
2. **Typography**: Update heading classes (`.h1`, `.h2`, etc.) and body text
3. **Backgrounds**: Modify `.hero`, `.section`, or background classes
4. **Animations**: Check for GSAP animations in `assets/animations.js`
5. **Colors**: Update CSS custom properties in `:root` or section-specific CSS

### Brand Guidelines:
- Maintain the cyberpunk/professional aesthetic
- Use the established color palette (forest green, neon teal, dark grey)
- Keep typography consistent (Poppins for headings, Inter for body)
- Preserve the particle system and modern animations
